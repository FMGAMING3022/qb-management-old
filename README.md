# qb-management

This is an **older version** of `qb-management`. The newer version of QBCore now uses `qb-banking` for financial management. If you prefer, you can still use this older version, as itâ€™s a reliable alternative to `qb-banking` or the updated `qb-management`. 

:small_blue_diamond: **Note**: The only difference in this file is the integration of the society money system; no other changes have been made.
